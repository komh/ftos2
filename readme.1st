Here's how to compile the font driver.

0. Read the DEVELFAQ ! Now ! Then make a WPS backup !

1. Compile FreeType library, simply go to "lib" directory,
   and type :

     nmake -f arch\os2\makefile.icc

2. Compile the font driver. Go to the "ifi" directory, then type

     nmake -f freetype.icc

   You should have created a file called "FreeType.dll". Copy it to
   your "ftos2" directory..

3. Run the "install.cmd" script, then reboot after closing all
   applications.

4. When your desktop is back, go to the font palette and try to
   install some new TrueType fonts. Enjoy the difference :-)

5. You can also compile a small memory usage dumper called "ftmem.c"
   to know how much memory the driver is using. Simply do

     nmake -f ftmem.icc

   Then launch it. A small window will appear with the current amount
   of memory allocated by the driver.
